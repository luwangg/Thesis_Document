Since the advent of modern digital communications in the 20th century there has been an explosion in the demand for wireless spectrum. As a result spectrum is becoming an increasingly scare resource. This demand is a direct result of the availability and relatively inexpensive cost of such wireless device. Therefore in such environments as militaristic theatres the probability of interfering transmissions, intended and unintended, has steadily grown to a point where techniques need to be consider to combat such occurrences. More directly, in such situations when interfering signals are partially or completely understood measures can be taken to overcome such difficulties. Under these assumptions several well know techniques are can be applied to combat such scenarios.  This research analyzes the feasibility of combining Antenna Subset Selection, Spectral Subtraction, and Blind Source Separation signal processing techniques to accomplish this goal.  Together they provide multiple avenues of signal separation to remove such jamming effects, for both narrow and wide bands, without hindering the mobility of the nodes themselves.
